JARO Privacy Policy

Last modified: December 12th 2014. Summary of changes can be consulted at the bottom of this Privacy Policy.

The aim of this Privacy Policy is to provide an overview on the privacy practices exercised by TraDigital with respect to the websites that TraDigital operates, including the www.tradigital.cz website (each, a Site) and any product and/or services TraDigital may offer to you (TraDigital Products), unless terms and conditions accompanying such TraDigital Products indicate otherwise.

1. Commitment to Privacy

TraDigital provides products and services including information technology consulting, productivity tools and heath care, and we know that you care about how your information is used and shared. At times we may need access to certain data on your PC, tablet, mobile phone or other applicable device. We respect your right to privacy. We want to make sure that you understand the type of information we collect about you, how it is used and the safeguards we use to protect it. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, TraDigital shall mean the business activities by Jaromir Malenko or any other company controlled by, controlling or under common control with TraDigital  (each, an Affiliate).

2. What Information Does TraDigital Collect?

The type of information that we collect and retain depends upon your interaction with our Site and/or our TraDigital Products. In general, there are two different categories of information we may collect:

2.1. Non-Personally Identifiable Information

Non-Personally Identifiable Information (NPII) refers to information that cannot be used to identify a specific person. The NPII TraDigital may collect include, without limitation, information about TraDigital Products and their installed features, information about your devices checkpoints, which may include path, file and application names, copies of files and applications including information on behavior of such applications, their settings and configurations, such as associated registry keys, the date and time, the internet address of the website from which you link directly to our Site, the name of the file or the words you search, and the browser you use to access our Site, type of device, advertising ID and the mobile network (mobile carrier) you use, third party software installed on a device and related settings, installation and uninstallation rates, language, technical parameters and manufacturer of a device, device security information. TraDigital collects NPII and shares them with its Affiliates when you use our TraDigital Products and when you visit the Site. This is captured via a standard cookie.

We may gather certain information automatically (when you use our TraDigital Products or visit our Sites); if this data is classified as PII (except and as described below), we will anonymize this data to remove personally identifiable information during or after the collection process, and store it in a database. Any data, including PII, that we have anonymized in this fashion will be considered NPII for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.

2.2. How Do We Use the NPII We Collect?

TraDigital may use the NPII for the purposes of building anonymous data profiles and/or sharing with our partners. TraDigital may retain this data for a period of up to five years. We also use NPII in a limited fashion for the administration and operation of our Site, and to generally improve the overall quality of experience with the information we provide on our Site. TraDigital may share NPII or anonymized data with third parties in order to improve our TraDigital Products and your experience using them. By visiting our Site or installing and using our TraDigital Products, you hereby agree with our collection and use of NPII as outlined in this Privacy Policy.

2.3. Personally Identifiable Information

Personal data and information (Personal Identifiable Information or PII) refers to information that can be used to identify a living individual. We may obtain PII from you through two types of interaction (manually submitted by you and automatically collected by us):

A. INFORMATION YOU SUBMIT TO US MANUALLY

We collect the PII you provide to us on our Site or through our TraDigital Products, including your name, address, email address, telephone number, and if you pay by credit card, your account information. This happens when you:
- Create a user account, place an order, register a product
- Requesting product support or other services
- Request information about TraDigital Products

B. INFORMATION AUTOMATICALLY COLLECTED AND STORED THROUGH INTERACTION

When you interact with TraDigital Products or Sites we may maintain a partial or full record about some or all of the following types of information:
- Your Internet Protocol ("IP") address

- Date and time, country, geographic location based on GPS/Wi-Fi/communications network local information.

When we obtain PII from you, we treat such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable laws. You may decide not to proceed with any activity that requests PII. By installing or using our TraDigital Products, you hereby agree with our collection and use of your PII as outlined in this Privacy Policy.

2.4. How Do We Use the PII We Collect?

The PII we collect is generally used to help us develop the best products and services for you, process your requests and transactions, to tell you about opportunities we think will be of interest to you, to customize your experience with our TraDigital Products and on our Site and to understand your needs so that we may provide you with the most suitable products and services. For example, we may use your PII to help us:
- Provide you with information about product upgrades, new products, services, research on future product ideas or improvements
- Send newsletters, informative e-mails or other information which has the nature of business announcements
- Create content that is relevant to you

If TraDigital is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale (Acquisition), TraDigital will abide by this Privacy Policy. Affected users will be informed if we transfer any PII or if PII becomes subject to a different privacy policy as a result of such Acquisition.

4. With Whom Do We Share Your Information?

TRADIGITAL WORLDWIDE

Since TraDigital is a global company, we provide information on users of TraDigital Products to our worldwide offices which are listed at www.tradigital.cz/contacts. By providing us with PII, you consent to our ability to send your PII between our Affiliates around the world to provide you with products and services. This may include cross-border transfers of user data. The PII and NPII that you have provided to us may be made accessible to these TraDigital offices for customer relationship management and marketing purposes.

THIRD PARTIES

TraDigital does not sell or rent your PII to third parties. TraDigital, like all major organizations, uses a range of third parties to provide services to TraDigital and to you  either directly or indirectly. Where relevant, these companies are required to comply with our data privacy and information security standards when handling Personal data. We may share your PII if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is: a) authorized by law or necessary to comply with a valid legal process or to deliver the product or service you require; b) in response to legal claims; c) required to protect and defend the rights, property or legitimate interests of TraDigital; d) necessary to protect personal safety, property or other rights of TraDigital or its customers or employees; e) in connection with a sale of all or part of our business or f) otherwise consented to by you. Such disclosure may include cross-border transfer of PII. If legally compelled to disclose your information to a third party, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you in advance of a disclosure unless legally prohibited.

SELECTED RESELLERS, DISTRIBUTORS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL PARTNERS

In certain circumstances, we may share certain of your PII, such as your e-mail contact, with selected TraDigital resellers, distributors and other distribution channel partners. This might include cross-border transfer of PII. Some of them may contact you, on our behalf, about products, services or offers that we believe are important to you or your business, or to fulfill any terms under your licensing and service relationship with TraDigital, and to provide you a local technical and customer support. If you are using any TraDigital Product with search functionality, we may share your IP address with search providers in order to fulfill your search requests. Please note they may have their own privacy policy which we encourage you to read and understand.

5. Rights and Responsibilities

If you have given your PII to TraDigital, you have the right to ask us to advise you of the scope of information TraDigital processes about you, the purpose and nature of the processing, and information on who we share it with. If you have given us your PII, you can also request to update, correct, or delete (assuming that this does not impact the services we are providing to you) it at any time. In addition you can opt out of marketing contact upon request, as explained below. If have any questions about this policy or any of the above, please email us at privacy@tradigital.cz or see instructions in the TraDigital Product. Please note: we may reject requests which risk the privacy of others or are unreasonable or repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (such as developing new systems or fundamentally changing an existing business practice), or would be extremely impractical.

6. TraDigital Update Bulletin and Other Communications

Some TraDigital Products enable TraDigital to transmit product and important service messages to your PC, tablet, mobile phone or other applicable device when you are connected to the TraDigital Server. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy an TraDigital Server means any TraDigital Products related server operated by any TraDigital company. If you do not wish to continue receiving our e-mail newsletters, bulletins, or other information from TraDigital, you can opt-out at any time by following the relevant unsubscribe process outlined in the applicable email or newsletter.
